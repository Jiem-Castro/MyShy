  <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s"> Hi, Shy! Well I am waiting for this moment since last month and I'm hiding it from you.
    You know, every day with you feels like a celebration. The way you laugh, the way you care, the way you make my world a 
    little less chaotic and a lot more beautiful, it's everything I never knew I needed. This Valentine’s Day, I don’t just 
    want to give you flowers or chocolates. I want to give you something far more important, my time, my effort, my love. 
    I want to remind you how much you mean to me, not just today, but every single day.
    So, here I am, asking you the question that has been on my mind......
    </p>
    <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-4s">
    <br><b>Before you go, I have one more thing to ask you. But I’ll only ask if you let me.</b>
   <br><b>If you’re ready, click the button below. </b> 
    </p>
  <button class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-5s" id="yesButton" onclick="openques()">Ask me!</button>
